# 🔐 Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Hey there! 👋 This project is my personal playground for learning, so while I’m the one and only maintainer, I still take security seriously (mostly 🧐). If you stumble upon a security issue, I’d love to hear about it — it’s all part of the learning journey!

### How to Report a Vulnerability 🕵️‍♂️

1. **Email me** 📧: Drop me a message at [utkarsh060902@gmail.com](mailto:utkarsh060902@gmail.com) with:
   - A quick description of the issue 📝
   - Steps to reproduce it 🔄
   - Any other tips or tricks you think might help! 💡

2. **Response Time** 🕒: Since this is a solo learning project, my response time might vary (I could be swamped with bugs or just sleeping 😴). But I’ll do my best to respond ASAP!

3. **Acknowledgment** 🙏: If you help me out, I’ll give you a shoutout (and probably eternal gratitude) in the project. ⭐

## Supported Versions

Honestly, I’m just learning as I go, so all "versions" are supported (or not 😅). Let’s just say I’ll do my best to patch things up as they come.

Thank you for helping me on this learning journey and making this project safer for... well, mostly me! 😂

For non-security stuff, feel free to open an issue or just say hi!

Happy coding! 🚀
